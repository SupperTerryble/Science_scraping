Title: Synthesis of ZIF-8
Authors: John Doe et al.

Abstract:
We report the synthesis of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8) using a solvothermal method.

Experimental Section:
ZIF-8 was synthesized by dissolving 2.0 g of Zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 1.5 g of 2-methylimidazole in 50 mL of methanol. The solution was stirred for 1 hour and then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. The mixture was heated at 120 C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol three times.
